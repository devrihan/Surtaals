                    its focus is bringing communities together. Although it also has a rich historical tradition, the
                    classical form has been codified, studied and elaborated upon in a very disciplined way. Classical
                    music is inspired by folk melodies and forms but the majority of the repertoire requires more rigour
                    and in-depth training.Indian classical music can be learned in many institutions and has been
                    heavily documented and notated but learning through observation, listening and memory is still
                    paramount and connecting with an expert teacher is considered the most fruitful way to learn.Performances take place in a chamber setting and focus on the solo performer, who is accompanied by a drone and rhythm. Melody, and the relationship between notes, is more important than harmony.</h4>

                <h1>What Makes Indian Music Unique</h1>
                <p>Indian music typically contains no harmony, can be completely improvised, and is rarely written down.
                    So how do Indian musicians manage to play together? In this segment, weâ€™ll learn about rhythmic
                    patterns called taal, music unique to certain communities and even times of the year, and if
                    deep-rooted musical traditions can continue as India undergoes fast-paced growth and
                    modernization.The geographic, linguistic, and cultural diversity of India contributes to a broad
                    range of musical styles within Indian music. Certain folk styles and traditions of music important
                    to one region may be virtually unknown in others. In this segment, weâ€™ll learn about many common
                    elements of Indian musicâ€”ragas, drones, improvisation, and the celebrity of being a Bollywood
                    playback singer.
